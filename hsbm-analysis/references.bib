  abstract = {Real-world complex networks are composed of non-random quantitative interactions. Identifying communities of nodes that tend to interact more with each other than the network as a whole is a key research focus across multiple disciplines, yet many community detection algorithms only use information about the presence or absence of interactions between nodes. Weighted modularity is a potential method for evaluating the quality of community partitions in quantitative networks. In this framework, the optimal community partition of a network can be found by searching for the partition that maximizes modularity. Attempting to find the partition that maximizes modularity is a computationally hard problem requiring the use of algorithms. QuanBiMo is an algorithm that has been proposed to maximize weighted modularity in bipartite networks. This paper introduces two new algorithms, LPAwb+ and DIRTLPAwb+, for maximizing weighted modularity in bipartite networks. LPAwb+ and DIRTLPAwb+ robustly identify partitions with high modularity scores. DIRTLPAwb+ consistently matched or outperformed QuanBiMo, while the speed of LPAwb+ makes it an attractive choice for detecting the modularity of larger networks. Searching for modules using weighted data (rather than binary data) provides a different and potentially insightful method for evaluating network partitions.},

  abstract = {A key question in human gut microbiome research is what are the robust structural patterns underlying its taxonomic composition. Herein, we use whole metagenomic datasets from healthy human guts to show that such robust patterns do exist, albeit not in the conventional enterotype sense. We first introduce the concept of mixed-membership enterotypes using a network inference approach based on stochastic block models. We find that gut microbiomes across a group of people (hosts) display a nested structure, which has been observed in a number of ecological systems. This finding led us to designate distinct ecological roles to both microbes and hosts: generalists and specialists. Specifically, generalist hosts have microbiomes with most microbial species, while specialist hosts only have generalist microbes. Moreover, specialist microbes are only present in generalist hosts. From the nested structure of microbial taxonomies, we show that these ecological roles of microbes are generally conserved across datasets. Our results show that the taxonomic composition of healthy human gut microbiomes is associated with robustly structured combinations of generalist and specialist species.},

Here we propose zeta (z) diversity, the number of species shared by multiple assemblages, as a concept and metric that unifies incidence-based diversity measures, patterns, and relationships. Unlike other measures of species compositional turnover, zeta diversity partitioning quantifies the complete set of diversity components for multiple assemblages, comprehensively representing the spatial structure of multispecies distributions. To illustrate the application and ecological value of zeta diversity, we show how it scales with sample number, grain, and distance. Zeta diversity reconciles several different biodiversity patterns, including the species accumulation curve, the species-area relationship, multispecies occupancy patterns, and scaling of species endemism. Exponential and power-law forms of zeta diversity are associated with stochastic versus niche assembly processes. Zeta diversity may provide new insights on biodiversity patterns, the processes driving them, and their response to environmental change.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            The assessment of microbial diversity and distribution is a major concern in environmental microbiology. There are two general approaches for measuring community diversity: quantitative measures, which use the abundance of each taxon, and qualitative measures, which use only the presence/absence of data. Quantitative measures are ideally suited to revealing community differences that are due to changes in relative taxon abundance (e.g., when a particular set of taxa flourish because a limiting nutrient source becomes abundant). Qualitative measures are most informative when communities differ primarily by what can live in them (e.g., at high temperatures), in part because abundance information can obscure significant patterns of variation in which taxa are present. We illustrate these principles using two 16S rRNA-based surveys of microbial populations and two phylogenetic measures of community {$\beta$} diversity: unweighted UniFrac, a qualitative measure, and weighted UniFrac, a new quantitative measure, which we have added to the UniFrac website (               http://bmf.colorado.edu/unifrac               ). These studies considered the relative influences of mineral chemistry, temperature, and geography on microbial community composition in acidic thermal springs in Yellowstone National Park and the influences of obesity and kinship on microbial community composition in the mouse gut. We show that applying qualitative and quantitative measures to the same data set can lead to dramatically different conclusions about the main factors that structure microbial diversity and can provide insight into the nature of community differences. We also demonstrate that both weighted and unweighted UniFrac measurements are robust to the methods used to build the underlying phylogeny.},

Further, we provide evidence that abiotic factors influence the structuring of the sponge microbiome when considering all microbes present, but biotic interactions drive the assembly of more intimately associated `core' microorganisms.

  abstract = {The past 30 years have seen both a surge of interest in assessing ecological interactions using tools borrowed from network theory and an explosion of data on the occurrence of microbial symbionts thanks to next-generation sequencing. Given that classic network methods cannot currently measure the respective effects of different environmental and biological drivers on network structure, we here present two methods to elucidate the determinants of bipartite interaction networks. The first method is based on classifications and compares communities within networks to the grouping of nodes by treatment or similar controlling groups. The second method assesses the link between multivariate explanatory variables and network structure using redundancy analyses after singular value decomposition. In both methods, the significance of effects can be gauged through two randomizations. Our methods were applied to experimental data on Daphnia magna and its interactions with gut microbiota and bacterioplankton. The whole network was affected by Daphnia's diet (algae and/or cyanobacteria) and sample type, but not by Daphnia genotype. At coarse grains, bacterioplankton and gut microbiota communities were different. At this scale, the structure of the gut microbiota-based network was not linked to any explanatory factors, while the bacterioplankton-based network was related to both Daphnia's diet and genotype. At finer grains, Daphnia's diet and genotype affected both microbial networks, but the effect of diet on gut microbiota network structure was mediated solely by differences in microbial richness. While no reciprocal effect between the microbial communities could be found, fine-grained analyses presented a more nuanced picture, with bacterioplankton likely affecting the composition of the gut microbiota. Our methods are widely applicable to bipartite networks, can elucidate both controlled and environmental effects in experimental setting using a large amount of sequencing data and can tease apart reciprocal effects of networks on one another. The twofold approach we propose has the advantage of being able to tease apart effects at different scales of network structure, thus allowing for detailed assessment of reciprocal effects of linked networks on one another. As such, our network methods can help ecologists understand huge datasets reporting microbial co-occurrences within different hosts.},

We use a hierarchical Bayesian model with latent layers and employ spike-and-slab priors for both edge and covariate selection. For posterior inference, we develop a novel variational inference scheme with an expectation\textendash maximization step, to enable efficient estimation. Through simulation studies, we demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms existing methods in its accuracy of network recovery. We show the practical utility of our model via an application to microbiome data. The human microbiome has been shown to contribute too many of the functions of the human body, and also to be linked with a number of diseases. In our application, we seek to better understand the interaction between microbes and relevant covariates, as well as the interaction of microbes with each other. We call our algorithm simultaneous inference for networks and covariates and provide a Python implementation, which is available online.},

The Bayesian inference approach provides a methodologically correct answer to the very central question in network analysis of whether patterns of large-scale structure can in fact be supported by statistical evidence. Besides this practical aspect, it also opens a window into the fundamental limits of network analysis itself, giving readers a theoretical underpinning we can use to understand more about the nature of network systems.

  abstract = {Discovering and characterizing the large-scale topological features in empirical networks are crucial steps in understanding how complex systems function. However, most existing methods used to obtain the modular structure of networks suffer from serious problems, such as being oblivious to the statistical evidence supporting the discovered patterns, which results in the inability to separate actual structure from noise. In addition to this, one also observes a resolution limit on the size of communities, where smaller but well-defined clusters are not detectable when the network becomes large. This phenomenon occurs for the very popular approach of modularity optimization, which lacks built-in statistical validation, but also for more principled methods based on statistical inference and model selection, which do incorporate statistical validation in a formally correct way. Here, we construct a nested generative model that, through a complete description of the entire network hierarchy at multiple scales, is capable of avoiding this limitation and enables the detection of modular structure at levels far beyond those possible with current approaches. Even with this increased resolution, the method is based on the principle of parsimony, and is capable of separating signal from noise, and thus will not lead to the identification of spurious modules even on sparse networks. Furthermore, it fully generalizes other approaches in that it is not restricted to purely assortative mixing patterns, directed or undirected graphs, and ad hoc hierarchical structures such as binary trees. Despite its general character, the approach is tractable and can be combined with advanced techniques of community detection to yield an efficient algorithm that scales well for very large networks.},

In maize, root growth advances several centimeters each day, with the locations, quality and quantity of rhizodeposition changing. We investigated the assembly of communities of prokaryotes (archaea and bacteria) and their protistan predators (Cercozoa, Rhizaria) along the longitudinal root axis of maize (Zea mays L.). We grew maize plants in an agricultural loamy soil and sampled rhizosphere soil at distinct locations along maize roots. We applied high-throughput sequencing, followed by diversity and network analyses in order to track changes in relative abundances, diversity and co-occurrence of rhizosphere microbiota along the root axis. Apart from a reduction of operational taxonomic unit (OTU) richness and a strong shift in community composition between bulk soil and root tips, patterns of microbial community assembly along maize-roots were more complex than expected. High variation in beta diversity at root tips and the root hair zone indicated substantial randomness of community assembly. Root hair zone communities were characterized by massive co-occurrence of microbial taxa, likely fueled by abundant resource supply from rhizodeposition. Further up the root where lateral roots emerged processes of community assembly appeared to be more deterministic (e.g., through competition and predation). This shift toward significance of deterministic processes was revealed by low variability of beta diversity, changes in network topology, and the appearance of regular phylogenetic co-occurrence patterns in bipartite networks between prokaryotes and their potential protistan predators. Such patterns were strongest in regions with fully developed laterals, suggesting that a consistent rhizosphere microbiome finally assembled. For the targeted improvement of microbiome function, such knowledge on the processes of microbiome assembly on roots and its temporal and spatial variability is crucially important.},

  abstract = {Background Microbiome studies are often limited by a lack of statistical power due to small sample sizes and a large number of features. This problem is exacerbated in correlative studies of multi-omic datasets. Statistical power can be increased by finding and summarizing modules of correlated observations. Additionally, modules provide biological insight as groups of microbes can have relationships among themselves. Results To address these challenges we developed SCNIC: Sparse Cooccurrence Network Investigation for Compositional data. SCNIC is open-source software that can generate correlation networks and detect and summarize modules of highly correlated features. We applied SCNIC to a published dataset comparing microbiome composition in men who have sex with men (MSM) who were at a high risk of contracting HIV to non-MSM. By applying SCNIC we achieved increased statistical power and identified microbes that not only differed with MSM-status, but also correlated strongly with each other, suggesting shared environmental drivers or cooperative relationships among them. Conclusions SCNIC provides an easy way to generate correlation networks, identify modules of correlated features and summarize them for downstream statistical analysis. Although SCNIC was designed considering properties of microbiome data, such as compositionality, it can be applied to a variety of data types including metabolomics data and used to integrate multiple data types. Using SCNIC allows for the identification of functional microbial relationships at scale while increasing statistical power.},

Here we present a global Porifera microbiome survey, set out to establish the ecological and evolutionary drivers of these host\textendash microbe interactions. We show that sponges are a reservoir of exceptional microbial diversity and major contributors to the total microbial diversity of the world's oceans. Little commonality in species composition or structure is evident across the phylum, although symbiont communities are characterized by specialists and generalists rather than opportunists. Core sponge microbiomes are stable and characterized by generalist symbionts exhibiting amensal and/or commensal interactions. Symbionts that are phylogenetically unique to sponges do not disproportionally contribute to the core microbiome, and host phylogeny impacts complexity rather than composition of the symbiont community. Our findings support a model of independent assembly and evolution in symbiont communities across the entire host phylum, with convergent forces resulting in analogous community organization and interactions.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Human microbiome studies are within the realm of compositional data with the absolute abundances of microbes not recoverable from sequence data alone. In compositional data analysis, each sample consists of proportions of various organisms with a sum constrained to a constant. This simple feature can lead traditional statistical treatments when naively applied to produce errant results and spurious correlations. METHODS: We review the origins of compositionality in microbiome data, the theory and usage of compositional data analysis in this setting and some recent attempts at solutions to these problems. RESULTS: Microbiome sequence data sets are typically high dimensional, with the number of taxa much greater than the number of samples, and sparse as most taxa are only observed in a small number of samples. These features of microbiome sequence data interact with compositionality to produce additional challenges in analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Despite sophisticated approaches to statistical transformation, the analysis of compositional data may remain a partially intractable problem, limiting inference. We suggest that current research needs include better generation of simulated data and further study of how the severity of compositional effects changes when sampling microbial communities of widely differing diversity.},

This paper presents an approach based on topic modeling to accomplish this integration task. More specifically, we show how an algorithm based on a hierarchical version of stochastic block modeling can be naturally extended to integrate any combination of 'omics data. We test this approach on breast cancer samples from the TCGA database, integrating data on messenger RNA, microRNAs, and copy number variations. We show that the inclusion of the microRNA layer significantly improves the accuracy of subtype classification. Moreover, some of the hidden structures or ``topics'' that the algorithm extracts actually correspond to genes and microRNAs involved in breast cancer development and are associated to the survival probability.},

Given a collection of models, however, an outstanding key task is to determine which one provides a more accurate description of the network at hand, discounting statistical fluctuations. This problem can be approached using two principled criteria that at first may seem equivalent: selecting the most plausible model in terms of its posterior probability; or selecting the model with the highest predictive performance in terms of identifying missing links. Here we show that while these two approaches yield consistent results in most cases, there are also notable instances where they do not, that is, where the most plausible model is not the most predictive. We show that in the latter case the improvement of predictive performance can in fact lead to overfitting both in artificial and empirical settings. Furthermore, we show that, in general, the predictive performance is higher when we average over collections of models that are individually less plausible than when we consider only the single most plausible model.},

The problem of finding a topic structure in a dataset was recently recognized to be analogous to the community detection problem in network theory. Leveraging on this analogy, a new class of topic modeling strategies has been introduced to overcome some of the limitations of classical methods. This paper applies these recent ideas to TCGA transcriptomic data on breast and lung cancer. The established cancer subtype organization is well reconstructed in the inferred latent topic structure. Moreover, we identify specific topics that are enriched in genes known to play a role in the corresponding disease and are strongly related to the survival probability of patients. Finally, we show that a simple neural network classifier operating in the low dimensional topic space is able to predict with high accuracy the cancer subtype of a test expression sample.},

  abstract = {All animals studied to date are associated with symbiotic communities of microorganisms. These animal microbiotas often play important roles in normal physiological function and susceptibility to disease; predicting their responses to perturbation represents an essential challenge for microbiology. Most studies of microbiome dynamics test for patterns in which perturbation shifts animal microbiomes from a healthy to a dysbiotic stable state. Here, we consider a complementary alternative: that the microbiological changes induced by many perturbations are stochastic, and therefore lead to transitions from stable to unstable community states. The result is an `Anna Karenina principle' for animal microbiomes, in which dysbiotic individuals vary more in microbial community composition than healthy individuals\textemdash paralleling Leo Tolstoy's dictum that ``all happy families look alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way''. We argue that Anna Karenina effects are a common and important response of animal microbiomes to stressors that reduce the ability of the host or its microbiome to regulate community composition. Patterns consistent with Anna Karenina effects have been found in systems ranging from the surface of threatened corals exposed to above-average temperatures, to the lungs of patients suffering from HIV/AIDs. However, despite their apparent ubiquity, these patterns are easily missed or discarded by some common workflows, and therefore probably underreported. Now that a substantial body of research has established the existence of these patterns in diverse systems, rigorous testing, intensive time-series datasets and improved stochastic modelling will help to explore their importance for topics ranging from personalized medicine to theories of the evolution of host\textendash microorganism symbioses.},

Secondly, with the use of the community detection of LPA in weighted bipartite graphs, the community modules of the two networks are obtained. Finally, two networks are compared to analyse the differences between healthy people and IBD people from several perspectives, such as NMI, centrality, clustering coefficient, species and compounds related to IBD disease, and cross-validation is performed to prove that all results are reliable and robust. The result shows that the gut microbial communities of healthy people and IBD patients are quite different, and the diversity and stability declined. From the clustering results, it can be judged that the distribution of disease-related bacteria changed.},
